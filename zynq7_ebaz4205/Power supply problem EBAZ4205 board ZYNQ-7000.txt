Power supply problem EBAZ4205 board ZYNQ-7000

When starting a user application, an error like this appears:
"Memory write error at 0xF8000B50. Invalid DAP IDCODE. Invalid DAP ACK value: 0"
The address is subject to change and is within the System Level Control Registers (slcr) address range
in particular, the registers responsible for working with DDR memory.
The reason is lack of power when using USB source and other +5V units.
The current consumption is small, varied within 80-170mA but has not been studied in details.
A solution is to raise the supply voltage, at 7.5V the board already worked flawlessly.
Additionally, the place for the diode D24 was shorted, which connected the smoothing capacitors EC2, EC6.
However, in this case, the power connector J4 should not be used due to the risk of polarity reversal !
